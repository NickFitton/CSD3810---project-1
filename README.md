## Maze Solver

## Description
A processing project that uses the reacTIVision table.\
On the table there is a maze with an entity that is tasked with exiting the maze.\
The user can control the entity by putting block on the table, then pressing the go button.\
The order of the blocks defines the order of actions.\
So for example putting blocks 1, 2, 3 then 4 would result in the robot going up then right then down then left.\
There are also blocks to define actions such as loops and if statements.\
The blocks given can interlock like jigsaw pieces so that it's easier for the system to understand and so that it's easier for a user to understand.\
There is a sliding bar to define how fast the robot goes.\
The final score of the maze depends on how long it took to complete the maze.\
The aim of the project is to help get people to understand code structure using a Tangible User Interface.

## Evaluation
To evaluate our prototype, we plan to present the prototype to first year Computer Science students so that they can interact with the table.


We will get individuals and groups to interact with the table to see who did better and if the activity helped them understand the programming.\
We will write written observations of the students.\
If the students use the table in a way we don't expect, record the new interaction as an example of beyond simple usability.\
We will then give them a questionnaire or google form to get their opinion of the project, using scaled questions, open ended and closed questions.\

## TODO
- [ ] Chained if statements don't work
- [ ] Complete if statements condition cannot be changed
- [ ] Play/pause & reset buttons
- [ ] Visuals

## Possible improvements
* Project is not Turing complete, other functionality such as while loops and multiple things in an if statement havn't been done
